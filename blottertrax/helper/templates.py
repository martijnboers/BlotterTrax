This post has been removed due to the artist having been posted too recently. No artist may be posted more than once a week and you may not use the same song within a 30 day period. Artists with posts that score more than 100pts may not be posted for the next month; artists that gain multiple posts of 100pts will be put on a cooldown for up to 90 days.
